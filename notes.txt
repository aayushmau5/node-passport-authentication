//This will be a important notes on the passport authentication and how it works behind the scenes.

User authentication options -> 1.Sessions (least complex)
                               2.JWT(JSON web token)
                               3.OAuth
                               4.Other/Ad-Hoc

Authentication -> Who the user is
Authorization -> Who has the access

Passport JS =>
    *Strategy -> An authentication mechanism OR a way to verify.
    
    Passport JS is a framework that is a middleware that integrates with expressjs application.
    It handle all the authentication logic using the specific Strategy that we choose.

Few Points =>

1. On each HTTP request, Passport will use a "Strategy" to determine whether the requestor has 
permission to view that resource
2. If the user does not have permission, a 401 Unauthorized Error is thrown
3. Each Strategy uses the passportjs framework as a template

* The local Strategy utilized cookies, express sessions and some authentication logic.

HTTP Headers =>
There are 3 types of headers => 1. General Header 
                                2. Request Header 
                                3. Response Header

When we first visit a website, in Response header, there is a key value pair named 'set-cookie' which sets the 
cookie in the client side. Now this cookie is sent to the server with every request header. 
This cookie can be used for Authorization.

Express Sessions =>
